Welcome to the Open Media Toolkit V2.5.0! 

You'll find everything you need to use this powerful C++ framework in this archive. OMT is distributed under the LGPL license (see docs/lgpl.txt for a complete license description).

For more informations about the Open Media Toolkit read the "docs/Introduction.pdf" file.

If you just want to take a look of what you can do with OMT, I would suggest that you try the samples. You will find the MacOSX executables in "macos/samples/build/" (we do not support anymore the OS 9 so you won't find classic executables, however you can build them yourself using CodeWarrior). The Windows versions are in "mswindows/samples/".

OMT is free, however support is not. So if you need support, write to support@garagecube.com to know our prices and solutions.

You can also find the latest version of OMT on "www.garagecube.com".
