# Open Media Toolkit 2.5.0

> *The Open Media Toolkit is a C++ platform independent framework destined to the development of real time 2D/3D multimedia applications.*

This is an unofficial mirror of Open Media Toolkit version 2.5.0, released sometime around April 2003. Everything in this repository is untouched, with the exceptions of this added `README.md` and the `LICENSE` file. I'm uploading it here because, as far as I can tell, the only existing copy is on SourceForge. I'm afraid it may disappear from there someday.

If you want the exact zip files that were released back in 2003, you can find them on the [open-media-toolkit-release-files](https://github.com/RoadrunnerWMC/open-media-toolkit-release-files) repository. (I would have uploaded them as a tagged release on this repository, but GitHub doesn't allow release files to be that large.)

I'm not affiliated with the developers of Open Media Toolkit in any way.

## Original readme (`ReadMe.txt`)

> Welcome to the Open Media Toolkit V2.5.0! 
>
> You'll find everything you need to use this powerful C++ framework in this archive. OMT is distributed under the LGPL license (see docs/lgpl.txt for a complete license description).
>
> For more informations about the Open Media Toolkit read the "docs/Introduction.pdf" file.
>
> If you just want to take a look of what you can do with OMT, I would suggest that you try the samples. You will find the MacOSX executables in "macos/samples/build/" (we do not support anymore the OS 9 so you won't find classic executables, however you can build them yourself using CodeWarrior). The Windows versions are in "mswindows/samples/".

> OMT is free, however support is not. So if you need support, write to support@garagecube.com to know our prices and solutions.

> You can also find the latest version of OMT on "www.garagecube.com".
